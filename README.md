# x-tracer
x-tracer provides the process-level visibility inside the Kubernetes pod in real time. As containers are isolated, lightweight which makes it difficult to look inside what 
could go wrong because they totally run on a separate namespace and PIDs inside containers are different as from their hosts which doesn't provide us with a clear view of 
what processes are running inside a particular pod or container. To make it simple, x-tracer is beautifully integrated with BCC tools to provide such kind of visibility.

Currently, x-tracer includes 7 ebp tools(BCC),probes to trace the process events:
1. Tcp connections: closed, active, established, life
2. Block device I/O 
3. New executed processes
4. Cache kernel function calls
